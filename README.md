## Program documentation (as seen in the help menu)
### Using Percentifier

1.  To set the total, click on the number after 'Out of' to change it,
    then press 'set' once you are happy with it.
2.  To calculate a percentage just type the number followed by enter if
    it does not automatically calculate.
3.  If you are inputting decimal numbers (such as to award half-marks),
    **make sure you enable decimal mode by pressing the 'd' key**. This
    will disable the automatic calculation feature, which is problematic
    if you are inputting decimals (see 'Why Percentifier is the best').
4.  The answer will be displayed in the left-hand box on the second row
    (labelled 'last percentage').
5.  A history of your calculations will be displayed in the
    greeny-yellow section as you calculate.

### Notes

  - Percentages are rounded to the nearest whole number.
  - History and the total will reset if the page is refreshed.

### Why Percentifier is the best (and surprisingly quick):

  - This tool is optimised for use by teachers calculating percentages
    on test papers. This is why the total remains the same between
    calculations.
  - The answer will automatically calculate itself if the input is the
    same length as the total unless decimal mode is enabled (as decimal
    numbers can be longer than the total),
